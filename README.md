# BuyMeACoffe-Dapp

Buy Me A Coffee is a popular website that creators, educators, entertainers, and all kinds of people use to create a landing page where anyone can send some amount of money as a thank you for their services. 

In this Dapp we have a "Buy Me a Coffee" smart contract that allows visitors to send you (fake) ETH as tips and leave nice messages, using Alchemy, Hardhat, Ethers.js, and Ethereum Goerli.
